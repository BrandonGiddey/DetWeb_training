# Guide to annotating images in DetWeb

## Introduction

Sango is a 60 000 ha property located within the Save Valley Conservancy (SVC) in the south-east lowveld of Zimbabwe. Since 1998 Sango has used a Cessna 206 to conduct a total wildlife count following the traditional Rear Seat Observer (RSO) method. However, photocounts are proving to be a safer, more cost effective, and possibly more accurate method of counting animals. Sango thus aims to replace its traditional RSO count with a photo count.    

In September 2024 Sango conducted a photo count alongside their RSO count. A brief methodology of the image aquisition is provided below, however, the objective of this document is to provide training for the manual annotation of these images. Roughly 30 000 images were taken during the survey. 

#### Brief methodology for image aquisition 

Two 61mp Sony cameras with Zeiss Ventum 21mm fixed focus lenses were housed in a pod attached to the fuselage of a Savanna. One camera pointed left and the other right, each set at 36 degrees off the vertical. A Lightware laser range finder (lidar) was used to display actual altitude to the pilot and log distance above ground for each shot. A North dual frequency GPS acquired position and speed information and a Bosch inertial unit allowed aircraft tip, roll and yaw to be recorded. The triggering system controlling the cameras was set at a 2 second interval. This yielded image overlaps of between 30% and 70% depending on where in the image it was assessed and the altitude. Below is an image depicting the flight path (dotted line) and how the images overlapped. Flight paths or transects were orientated east-west and spaced at 750 m intervals (i.e., 375 m either side of the plane). Altitude was kept constant between 300 and 450 feet AGL. Speed was kept constant between 130 and 170 km/h. Roughly 30 000 images were captured during the survey.

## Where to annotate?

Each image is divided into 15 jobs. The jobs will be demarcated by a blue annotation box. Annotations should be made in the blue box only. If you see an animal outside of the blue box you can annotate it but do not spend time and effort looking outside the blue box as these areas will come up again in another job.

## How to annotate?

LEFT CLICK on the center of the animals body. Do not left click next to or on top of the animal. 

An icon will appear. 

To choose a different species RIGHT CLICK on the icon. A list of options will appear. LEFT CLICK on your chosen option. The colour of the icon should change to the colour which has been associated to that annotation. If you hover your curser over the icon a text box will appear confiriming your choice. 

To delete an annotation LEFT CLICK delete at the top of the list.

## What to annotate

Below is a list of annotation choices.

#### Notes

Annotate as unkown when you think it may be an animal but not sure.

Annotate as animal when you can identify that it is an animal but you are unsure of the species. 

Annotate as point of interest for anything man made e.g., vehicle, building, person.

### Tips and tricks

If you are struggling to identify a species due to image quality look at the animals shadow. The horns are often clearly visible in the shadow and can be used to help identify the species.

Look at colours you will start to recognise colour palletes for each species. Even when image quality is low you may be able identify the animal based on the colour of the pixels

Dont forget to look under trees! The oblique nature of the images allows you to view animals under trees. These areas are often over looked because of the shadow caste by the tree.

Scan from left to right - opposite to reading. It helps to keep focus and prevents 'zoning out'. 

If you have any of your own tips or techniques please share them!
